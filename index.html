            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
                at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure L
                atin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
                the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
                "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
                very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
                    reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
                    from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                    accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
                    and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy
                </li>
                <li>
                    Various versions have evolved over the years,
                    sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
                but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,
                or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use
                a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in
                the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks
                as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200
                Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
                reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour,
                or non-characteristic words etc.

                    ut I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
                    and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system,
                    and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
                    of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
                    but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
                    consequences that are extremely painful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
                    because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure
                    him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
                    exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
                    a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids
                    a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled
            and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
            the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
            through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
            are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
            and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
            every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
            business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
            The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection:
            he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

            Albert Schweitzer was a man whose reverence for life extended even to the lowliest of insects.
            Long before the environment became a major political issue, Schweitzer criticized a Western philosophical
            tradition that restricted the realm of ethics to relationships between human beings.

            He passionately strove to define a morality that would encompass all of God's creation.
            In The Animal World of Albert Schweitzer, the man remembered as the "jungle doctor" for his medical
            missionary service in central Africa reveals his personal and particular affection for a world where
            animals still ruled the landscape and humans moved among them at their peril. Here, among charming s
            tories about the large and changing menagerie of injured and orphaned animals he cared for, are accounts
            of attacks on humans by leopards, crocodiles, hippos, pythons and other creatures - relayed by a doctor
            acutely aware of the suffering of both man and beast.
